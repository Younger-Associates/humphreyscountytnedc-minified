<h2>Governor Lee, Commissioner McWhorter Announce Nashville Wire Products to Expand Manufacturing Operations in Humphreys County</h2>

<h4>Family-run business will expand Tennessee workforce by nearly 20%</h4>

<p><strong>NASHVILLE, Tenn.</strong> - Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Stuart C. McWhorter and Nashville Wire Products officials announced today the company&#39;s plans to establish a new manufacturing site in McEwen, Tennessee.</p>

<p>The facility is the company&#39;s sixth base in the Volunteer State and will add 102 new jobs, increasing the company&#39;s total workforce in Tennessee by 19%. In total, Nashville Wire Products plans to invest more than $20 million through the project.</p>

<p>Nashville Wire Products originally started in a garage as a tool and die shop. Since then, the company has expanded to include retail displays, shelving, wire baskets and other high-quality products. Three generations later, Nashville Wire Products remains a family-owned and -operated business with 10 U.S. locations and one in Mexico.</p>

<p>Since 2020, TNECD has supported nearly 140 economic development projects in Northern Middle Tennessee, resulting in nearly 35,000 job commitments and more than $9.9 billion in capital investments.</p>

<h2>Humphreys County Students Participate in Be Pro Be Proud Event</h2>

<p>Recently,&nbsp;548 students from 8th-12th grade had the chance to explore exciting career paths through this event! With 12 trade simulators on hand, our students dive into hands-on experiences that showcased the endless possibilities in the world of trades. From carpentry to electrical work, automotive repair to welding, our students got a taste of it all, thanks to the immersive setups. Alongside the hands-on activities, students also had the opportunity to learn more about the fantastic opportunities available at Nashville State Community College, Humphreys County Campus. A huge shoutout to everyone who made this event possible, especially OxyChem&nbsp;for sponsoring the bus and bus drivers to transport students during the week. Another thank you to the enthusiastic students who joined us on this journey of discovery and to Tennessee Valley Authority, who had a booth with gifts for the students! Here&#39;s to empowering our future workforce and fostering a community of skilled professionals!</p>
